# Time Series Analysis and Decomposition

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing and decomposing time series data to identify its components such as trend, seasonality, and cyclic patterns. The project uses two datasets: one with custom time series data and another with Yahoo stock data. The analysis includes plotting the data, performing differencing, and visualizing the decomposed components.

## Features
- Load and preprocess time series data.
- Plot time series data to visualize trends and patterns.
- Perform differencing to make the series stationary.
- Decompose the time series data to identify its components.

## Technical Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
